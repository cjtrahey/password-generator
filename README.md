## General info
<br>

* As a student, this project is intended to further develop our proficiency with JavaScript by creating a random character generator. By providing different classes of characters, this project is intended to introduce us to a real-world example of what a user product would look like, as random character generators (or in this case, a password generator).
<br>
<br>

* As a developer, this project is intended to show us an example of what a consumer product would look like, and how to create a product with functioning end goals for said consumer. With the ever-growing space that is the Internet, cybersecurity is at the forefront of many people's minds when it comes to protecting their assets. With a password generator such as this, those who seek security can rest, knowing that they have access to a password that is inevitably unique to them.

## Troubleshooting
Multiple issues came up during the completion of this assignment, some of which caused major defects within the final product.  <br>

* Due to a general lack of in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, the website itself is able to create various dialogue boxes detailing on what the user wants from their specific password, but it won't actually generate it.
